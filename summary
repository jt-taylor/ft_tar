Summary:
1. Recode "tar"
2. Make it work
3. ???
4. Profit!

V1.1
	Twitter task
V2.1
	ft_archive
	ft_unarchive
V2.2
	Recursive ft_archive
V2.3
	make ft_tar with archive unarchive capabilities
	also need the following flags
		-x		extract to disk from the archive
		-c		create a new archive
		-v		verbose output (list each name as written to or from archive)
					additional -v options produce additional output
		-f		read or write the archive to file ([-] goes to stdout// stdin)
		-t		list archive to stdout
		-p		manage permissions and dates (ustar format)
V2.4
	compatablity with the system tar
V2.5
	implement the -z option , this is just pipeing through gzip , ignored in extract mode
	this would only be an issue if you are storing the archive in something
		like a linked list , if you're making the header then sending that and the file
		to the file this should be simple to implement
